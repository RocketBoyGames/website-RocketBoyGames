      <h2>ABOUT THIS GAME:</h2>
      <br>
      <p>So you've learned some basic English? And you're ready to be immersed in an English speaking world of adventure? Then take control of Peter as he travels across the kingdom, solving puzzles, making friends and defeating monsters. His journey to save the princess mirrors your journey into learning English! </p>
      <br>
      <p>This game is designed to be entirely in English with no in-game translations and will be useful regardless of your native language. All interface, dialogue and narration is in simple English accompanied by carefully designed images and animations to help you understand the game play and objectives. </p>
      <br>
      <p>This is not a classroom, there are no quizzes or word matching exercises. The purpose of this game is to provide a fun but challenging environment for you to practice and learn through immersion. Just how we learn our native languages! </p>
      <br>

      </ul>
      <br>
      <h2>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:</h2>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li><b>"Is this game for beginners?"</b></li>
        <p>No... *unless* you're very serious about learning English through immersion, enjoy a challenge, and are willing to learn as you go. This game is particularly useful for people who already have a very basic level of English and want to put what they're learning into practice while improving their vocabulary. You'll get the best results if you spend a few weeks or months learning the basics before starting this game.</p>
        <br>
        <li><b>"Everything is in English without translation? Won't I feel overwhelmed?"</b></li>
        <p>Sometimes, yes! But don't be discouraged, you can absolutely complete this game even if you don't understand every word that's being said. If you can persevere you'll find that you're still able to understand your objectives and how to achieve them. New language learners often find themselves quite overwhelmed when first attempting to interact in the language they’re studying. This is a natural part of the process. Just watch for keywords and context, and don't be afraid to experiment!</p>
        <br>
        <li><b>"Will this be useful if I want to learn British English?"</b></li>
        <p>In short, yes. Especially if you are a beginner. The script and voice performances were done mostly by American English speakers but British and American English speakers can usually understand each other perfectly.</p>
        <br>
        <li><b>"How is this different to just playing any regular game in English"</b></li>
        <p>Games with language simple enough for beginners typically don't require much language comprehension to play. (Eg: most action platformers.) And narrative driven games have a lot of dialogue which is too advanced for learners. It's also rare to find those games with full audio dialogue available in other languages. We've used simple language designed for beginners and accompanied by helpful imagery. That said, we would recommend that you try playing some of your favorite RPGs in English. If you are able to understand all your objectives then congratulations! Your English is already quite excellent.</p>
        <br>
        <li><b>"Will you be releasing this game in other languages as well?"</b></li>
        <p>If there is sufficient support for this game then we will continue to release versions of the game to help players learn many other languages.</p>
        <br>
        <li><b>"Will it be available on other platforms? (macOS, Android, consoles etc)"</b></li>
        <p>Initially it will only be available for Windows PC, but soon we hope to release the game for macOS, Linux, consoles and mobile devices.</p>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h2>A WORD FROM THE CREATORS:</h2>
      <br>
      <p>This game is one of many resources you should use when learning a language and is particularly useful for learning common nouns, verbs and pronunciation. We recommend playing it in conjunction with resources that focus on teaching the nuances of grammar and verb conjugation.</p>
      <br>
      <p>ROCKET BOY GAMES is an independent games studio with the objective of providing fun alternatives to your language learning experience. With enough support we hope to create a variety of language learning games for a variety of other languages. We hope you will be part of that journey. Good luck!</p>
